# Part 2: Using Electronics
See Part 1 [Simulating using Scratch](/CarLightsScratch) where we modelled car lights in Scratch and coded them to respond to different key presses.

## Car Lights and Horn
In this session, we'll use electronic lights and a buzzer, and switches:
-Horn sounds when button pressed.
-Lights indicate Movement


| Movement      | Trigger        |     |
|:------------- |:-------------| :-----|
| Stop          | Red            | red | 
| Left          | 2 way switch  | left yellow lights flash front and rear |
| Right         | 2 way switch  | right yellow lights flash front and rear |
| -             | Blue button    | Horn beeps |

In Part 3 we'll use a Raspberry Pi to read the switches and write code to
1. play a tune when the horn button is pressed
2. flash the indicator lights for 3 seconds when the left-Right toggle switch is pressed.
