## Materials Required

1. SunFounder-PiCar-S Kit
2. 2 of 18650 Li-ion Rechargeable Battery (and battery charger)
3. Raspberry Pi and MicroSD card

## Build Notes

1. 2 of 18650 Li-ion Rechargeable Battery required (These are a different size than the normal AA type batteries.)
2. Remove all the paper from the plastic frame parts before starting
3. Make sure SSH is enabled on your Raspberry Pi before you install it in the car so you can access it; (the HDMI port is not accessible once the front wheel servo motor is installed)
4. If one or both wheels rotates in the wrong direction, edit the config file per the manual, and copy the config file to the directory where the Python script is running
