The Makeblock Neuron system offers over 30 electronic blocks, including a voice sensor, light sensor and infrared sensor. It makes it very easy for kids to create functional circuits easily e.g. an ultrasonic distance sensor,a voice-activated emoji. Components can be programmed also.
Overall, it's a very polished product and fun to play with.
