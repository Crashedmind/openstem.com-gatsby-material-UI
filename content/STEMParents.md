## Introduction
This is a gathering of my thoughts and experiences as a STEM parent (working in a profession that relates to Science, Technology, Engineering, Maths) sharing STEM knowledge with my kids, their peers, and their school.

## About Me
I work as a software security and system architect in the payments industry. My college education was in Electronic Engineering. I work in embedded software, originally as a software engineer, but now as an architect, specialising in security. I'm about half way through my working career age-wise, and near the top in terms of the technical ladder I chose.

My wife works as an environmental consultant (though also has an Electronic Engineering college education).

I have 2 kids: 
- a girl aged 11 who is very good at art, creativity, writing, Irish dancing, and academic subjects and environment in general.
- a boy aged 8 who has a knack for engineering and maths and games like card games, draughts and chess.
They both go to the same primary school.

In my limited spare time I enjoy learning and playing with new technologies.


## Why I got involved
- To spend fun time with my kids on something we all enjoy
- My kids learn and enjoy STEM (doing it with their friends reinforces this)
- People working in STEM professions can provide contemporary relevant content to kids 
- Schools prepare kids for life after school


## How I got involved
The school used to publish the school holiday calendar in an Excel sheet on their website. At the start of each school year, I converted this to a Google Calendar so that I would be automatically reminded about these holidays, and shared it with my daughter's class parent's group. One of the parents on the Parent's Association approached me about assisting the school to do this, and helping out on the school website which, at the time, needed an overhaul. Through this approach, I met another parent who was on the school board, and happened to live nearby. She acted as a liaison between me and the school.

I offered to assist on the school website, but suggested that the students do it, and I'd facilitate. I had been studying customer-centric product delivery for my work, and viewed the student as the customer of the school. As the website was the digital interface to parents, allowing the students to update it would bring the students and parents closer to the school. This led to a presentation to the school IT Committee insert link

Before the presentation I felt my biggest gap was being able to communicate with the school; I work in a very different culture and environment, and had no experience working with primary school staff. I sought advice from one of the parents who had done after-school classes and was used to working with the school. While, the presentation went well, the followup with the school didn't. While we spoke the same language, we may as well have been from different planets. I joined various Facebook STEM Teacher groups to better understand.

Before I got involved, one of the STEM parents did a class on statistics the previous year. This opened up the possibility in my mind and planted the seed.

In summer 2018, I took my kids and their friends to the Amazon open day at ITT Tallaght. They attended a Micro-bit coding class hosted by Keith Quille. I got talking to him, commending him on how well he delivered the class, and mentioned some of the STEM activities I did with my kids, and how I was trying to do these with their school. 

TO BE COMPLETED...





## Where to from here
- I'd like for this to scale i.e. for teachers, SNAs to deliver contemporary STEM content, with STEM parents becoming more involved
- I would not do this full time. I greatly admire teachers and what they do - but it is not for me as a full time activity. I have a full time demanding job that is rewarding personally and financially. So doing this part time is a good balance.
- Running an after school class is something I considered for the future. This would realise the Curriculum idea I originally wanted.
