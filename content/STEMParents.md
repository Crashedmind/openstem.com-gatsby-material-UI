STEM Parent


## Why I got involved
- To spend fun time with my kids on something we all enjoy
- My kids learn and enjoy STEM (doing it with their friends reinforces this)
- People working in STEM professions can provide contemporary relevant content to kids 
- Schools prepare kids for life after school


## How I got involved
Before I got involved, one of the techie parents did a class on statistics.

## Where to from here
- I'd like for this to scale i.e. for teachers, SNAs to deliver contemporary STEM content, with STEM parents becoming more involved
- I would not do this full time. I greatly admire teachers and what they do - but it is not for me. I have a full time demanding job that is rewarding personally and financially. I enjoy my own company and thinking time. So doing this part time is a good balance.
- Running an after school class is something I considered for the future. This would realise the Curriculum idea I originally wanted.
